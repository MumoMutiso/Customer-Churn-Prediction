About the Project
The churn rate is a metric that shows us the total percentage of clients who discontinue their subscriptions within a certain period.

Understandably, a high churn rate could affect a company's profitablity and also impact growth, so it's important to keep track of a company's churn rate and try to identify patterns among clients who discontinue their subscripitons in order to develop strategies to reach these clients with a better service, bonuses or any other incentive to keep them as clients for a long period of time.

In this project, I did an exploratory data analysis on a Telco dataset to find what the clients who left the company have in common and then I developed a machine learning model for churn prediction.


Customer Profile Overview
--------------------------------

👤 Customer ID: Unique identifier facilitating personalized engagement and loyalty programs for enhanced customer experience.

🔄 Churn Index: Dynamic metric gauging the propensity of customers to churn, enabling proactive retention measures and revenue protection.

💰 Total Charge: Financial indicator reflecting customer value and profitability, guiding pricing strategies and targeted promotions.

🛡️ Risk Level: Visualize churn risk levels to prioritize retention efforts and allocate resources effectively for maximum impact.

📝 Personal Details: Dive into demographic insights such as age, gender, and location to tailor offerings and communication channels to specific customer segments.

📄 Contract Details: Understand contract specifics like type, duration, and terms to optimize renewal strategies and minimize churn risk.

💼 Additional Insights: Explore service usage patterns, feedback, and engagement metrics to craft personalized retention strategies and foster long-term loyalty.

Limitations
----------------------------------------------
Limitation 1 : In this dataset, we can only see one type of each variables instead of real world situation of changing different options as time passes, e.g., in real world, people might want to try streaming service, but they might change their mind to leave the service next month.

Limitation 2 : We cannot only see these variables as whole factors to understand the exact reasons why customers left because they might leave for better price offered by competitors or the bad economy in certain time, etc. We also cannot see the time they leaked, so it's hard to infer those external situations.
